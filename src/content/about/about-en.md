Welcome to Mercury.

This is a personal blog centered on elegant typography, where I quietly record technical practice, tooling notes, and scattered reflections.

I care about the rhythm and whitespace of reading, and I prefer writing that is clean and to the point.

- Theme: Retypeset (Astro)
- Style: book-like layout with attention to detail
- Topics: frontend & backend practice, reading notes, essays

For conversation or feedback, feel free to reach me at `gxqmars@gmail.com`.
